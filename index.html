                    In the most visited borough of New York City lies a 67 Acre park with one hidden gem inside. Not the famous Central Park, but a much smaller one.
                    <br> <br>
                    
                    Fort Tryon park encases several sights that are unique to the park. From inside the park, is a full view of the grand structure that is the George Washington Bridge. An added bonus to this great sight the Hudson River and the State of New Jersey are in full view. <!--what is the town over the bridge? / the neighboring state of new jersey-->

                    <br>

                     Alas, we aren't here for some dusty old bridge, (Sorry bridge lovers, & George) we want the hidden gem! What is inside hidden away?

                        <caption><em>The Cloisters, MET Museum</em></caption>

                    There is a Museum that is only to be found at two iconic sites in New York City; Fifth Avenue and our very own The Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park. Yes, one of The Metropolitan Museums of Art lives in the very lovely Fort Tryon Park. The hidden gem!
                    <br> <br>

                    The Cloisters Museum might be a bit of a surprise to those not native to the area, as most Museums in the city are their own stand alone location.
